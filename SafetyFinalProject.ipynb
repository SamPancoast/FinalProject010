    "## Safety\n",
    "When determining the best neighborhood in Pittsburgh one of the most important metrics is safety. Without safety in a community can it really be considered the best? When first determining what data set would effectivly portray saftey in a community arrest were the first thing that came to mind, But when diving deeper into the arrest data set there were many cases where a non-violent crime was committed\n",
    "\n",
    "## Non-Traffic Citations\n",
    "The metric of Non-Traffic Citations is a great data set to showcase what type of community these neighborhoods have along with how safe they are. Some examples of Non-Traffic Citations are Disorderly Conduct, Public drunkenness, and possession of marajuana. In my opinion this data set does not only shows how safe you are in your neighborhood, but also shows the community within the neighborhood.\n",

I used the soulution for this equation to determine rankings. To give you an example of how I scored them, Swisshelm Park had the lowest Citation count to population for all of the nighborhoods, which was 0.00448. I initally scored it out of 100 and subtracted CitationPerPop multiplyed by 100. Giving Swisshelm Park a 95.6/100."
