    "Best education metric:\n",
    "\n",
    "To determine the best neighborhood in Pittsburgh, we decided to create a metric to determine which area has the best education. I decided a good measure of effective schooling is seeing which area has the highest rate of residents who graduated high school.\n",
    "\n",
    "Originally we wanted to base it off the effectiveness of schools for younger kids: middle school or elementary school. However, we found it hard to find good data to measure this. I found a dataset that listed the level of education attained by every resident of each area in Pittsburgh over 18 who chose to respond to the survey; this led me to focus on highschool graduation rates, because it is generally considered indicative of the effectiveness of an education from childhood to young-adulthood.\n",
    "\n",
    "This data was from a dataset gained from the 2014 ACS, question 11.\n",
    "\n",
    "The metric for \"best education\" measures what percentage of residents over 18 in each area earned a high school diploma or higher. Whichever area has the highest rate of graduating high school determines that area's score for \"best education\".\n",
    "\n",
    "For each area, I took the total number of residents with a high diploma or higher education and divided that by the total number of residents surveyed to get their score out of 1. I took this percentage and scaled it to make the total possible points for the area 30."
